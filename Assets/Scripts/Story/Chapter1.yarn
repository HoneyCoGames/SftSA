Lolo: Happy birthday, apo! I hope you made a wish when blowing out your candles.
-> Stargazer: I sure did!
    <<jump Did>>
-> Stargazer: I can't tell you my wish though. It's a secret.

Lolo: Haha, of course you can't, apo. Just keep that secret close to you. 
Lolo: Now, there is one more birthday gift that is waiting for you upstairs. 
Lolo: Come with me.

You follow your grandpa to your room. 
It's dark, and there's something set up near the open window looking out into the sea of suburban houses.
Stargazer: Is that what I think it is?
Lolo: Yes, your mom has been telling me how much you've learned about space in school recently 
Lolo: and how you couldn't stop talking about it.
Lolo: So I thought I would get you this.
Lolo: Surprise!
You hug your grandpa.
It's warm, like a star. But not a dangerous one.
You know that stars are like billiions of times hotter than a hug.
But this is nice.
Stargazer: Thank you lolo!
Stargazer: This is the best gift I've ever gotten!
Stargazer: Can you teach me how to user it?
Lolo: Oh! Here, let me help you with that.

[i]Use the WASD keys to move around with the telescope. Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out to get a better view of the stars[/i]
Stargazer: I can see them now lolo! The stars!
Grandpa: Mhm. Look over there, you'll see a constellation called Corvus.
-> Stargazer: What does Corvus mean?
    <<jump MeaningCorvus>>
-> Find Corvus.

Lolo: There it is!
Stargazer: I found it, but it doesn't look like a bird?
Lolo: That's because it doesn't actually look like one apo.
Lolo: They're just shapes that people a long time ago told stories about.
-> Stargazer: Can you tell me the story of Corvus?
    <<jump StoryCorvus>>
-> Stargazer: I wanna find another constellation!

Lolo: Okay, so there was a god called Apollo,
Lolo: and he had a raven with white feathers...
You listen to the rest of the story.
It was pretty interesting, but also sad.
Your grandpa also told you more about the constellation itself,
even the names of the stars in Corvus.
He explained to you that they meant different parts of a crow in Arabic.
Eventually, it was time for your grandpa to go home
so you had to say goodbye.
But that nigght, you continued to look at the stars above.
If stars had stories, do you think they would had stories about people too?

Lolo: Okay, apo.
Lolo: But I'm telling you now is that the constellations
Lolo: won't actually look like what their name implies.
Lolo: I also don't know how powerful this telescope is,
Lolo: but if we're lucky we can see a galaxy too.
Lolo: Wouldn't that be cool?
Lolo: I think this time of year a constellation called virgo might be visibile.
Your grandpa helps you find as many constellations as you can.
You learned that Virgo is what they call a "zodiac constellation" and everyone
who was ever born has one. Your zodiac is Gemini. Those are the twins.
Late in the night, you even started seeing shapes in the many stars yourself.
Now, it was getting late and your grandpa had to go home and you had to go to bed.
Or at least that's what your mom thought.
You ended up looking through the telescope some more.
You wonder if the stars look at the people down on Earth and talk about them
like people do with constellations.

It is way past your bedtime and you have school tomorrow. You should probably go to bed.
Sweet dreams to you and the stars,
for stars have dreams too.
At least that's what you think...
